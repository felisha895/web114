            <li>When should you use a switch statement in your projects?</li>

        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Because switch startements are great alternatives to if statements, it provides a more descriptive way of comparing values with multiple variants.</li>

        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prompt for favorite day: The program uses prompt to ask the user for their favorite day and stores it in the favDay variable.</li>
            <li>Switch statement: Use a switch statement with favDay.toLowerCase() to convert the input to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.</li>
            <li>Cases: Inside the switch statement, each case block checks if the favDay matches a specific day of the week (converted to lowercase).</li>
            <li>If a match is found, the corresponding message is displayed using console.log.</li>
            <li>Each case block needs a break statement to exit the switch statement after displaying the message.</li>
            <li>Default case: A default case handles any input that doesn't match a specific day. It displays a generic message.</li>
        </ol>
